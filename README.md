# Streamlit Substructure Search App

This is a **Streamlit app** for performing **substructure searches** in a **SMILES dataset**. Users can input datasets, define substructure queries using **SMARTS patterns**, and view matching molecules in an interactive interface.

## Features
- Upload a SMILES dataset (in CSV or other formats).
- Search for molecular substructures within the dataset using SMARTS patterns.
- Visualize and explore the results in an intuitive web-based interface.

## Installation
